Escape from Wikipedia
Copyright 2013 Aaron Graham-Horowitz

INTRODUCTION
Escape from Wikipedia v1.0 is the precursor to what I hope will soon be a game.  Right now, it is simply a set of interesting mechanics, that I hope you will enjoy playing around with.  If you have feedback about the game, you can send email to aarongrahamhorowitz(at)college.harvard.edu.  I would love to hear what you think, and any ideas you have for directions to take the game or ways to make it more enjoyable.

SETUP
If you are on Windows, to play simply double-click the batch file 'play.bat', or run the executable 'wikigame.exe' in the 'bin' folder. If you're not on Windows, you'll have to wait until I finish figuring out all this distribution stuff, or pull the source yourself from <https://github.com/aaronsgh/escape-from-wikipedia>.

GAMEPLAY
You will take on the role of a neat-o stick figure with a colorful afterimage and the power to double-jump and travel through hyperlinks on Wikipedia!  That's all!

CONTROLS:
  > Move left...................'a' or left-arrow
  > Move right..................'d' or right-arrow
  > Jump........................'w' or up-arrow (hold key to jump higher)
  > Follow hyperlink............'s' or down-arrow (while standing on blue word)
  > Restart at random page......'r'
  > Exit game....................escape-key

Enjoy!
