Escape from Wikipedia
Aaron Graham-Horowitz

I had this silly idea for a platformer style game where you run around the
inside of a Wikipedia page, jumping from word to word and following hyperlinks.

Right now I'm just trying to put together a proof-of-concept using pygame and
rabbyt. We'll see how it turns out.
